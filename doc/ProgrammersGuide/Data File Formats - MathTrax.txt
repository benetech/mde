There are two ways to import a data file to MathTrax. You can use a program like 
Excel to create a data table, with or without headings, and the save the file as 
a tab or comma-separated file. You can also create a tab-separated file in a 
text editor. In general, the time-series data must conform to the following 
conventions: 

  the first column must contain the values for the independent variable, 
  the first column values must be numeric: integers or decimals, 
  the first column must be in ascending order 

Please refer to the "Inputs" section of the Programmer's Guide for more 
information. 

Example 1: Column separated time-series data from a rocket simulation. 
      TIME(SEC) ACCEL(M/S2) VEL(M/S) ALT(M) RNG(M) FLTEL(DEG) DRAG(N) 
      0.050 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 85.000 0.000 
      0.100 8.502 0.141 0.002 0.000 85.000 0.000 
      0.150 23.165 0.933 0.025 0.002 85.000 0.000 

Example 2: Tab separated spatial data of x and y values for graph of y=3*x
      x y 
      -4 -12 
      -3 -9 
      -2 -6 
      -1 -3 
      0 0 
      1 3 
      2 6 
      3 9 
      4 12 

Example 3: Comma-separated table of the same data represented in Example 2. The 
Excel CSV format uses commas to separate values and it also uses quote 
characters to enclose text or numbers so you may include any commas or white 
space a value may contain. For example, a number value could contain commas if 
it was of the form "1,234,567". 

      x,y 
      -4,-12 
      -3,-9 
      -2,-6 
      -1,-3 
      0,0 
      1,3 
      2,6 
      3,9 
      4,12
